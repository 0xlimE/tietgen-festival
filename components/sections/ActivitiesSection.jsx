          Friday afternoon, you have the opportunity to participate in the the
          ultimate Tietgen Race. You will (with a partner) be tested at sea, on
          land and in the air on both speed, balance, craftiness, concentration
          and courage. It is a relay race, where you participate in teams of two
          - preferably with a theme and accompanying costumes. There is room for
          a total of 10 teams; first come, first served. The two best teams
          compete in a final round, where they have the opportunity to win a
          great prize and eternal honor.

            Saturday afternoon we invite you to watch a battle of science! Three
            cool residents of Tietgen will do a 5-7 minutes presentation
            inspired by a project they have worked on. They will each try to
            convince you that just their project is the most exciting.
          </p>
          <p>
            The brave participants are: <br />
            Mats, who will present the project: "Earlier signs of disease in the
            heart - new weapons in the fight against heart failure" <br />
            Yas, who will present: "The rules of war" <br />
            Andreas, who will present: "Career pressure and the
            contract-year-phenomenon among professional basketball players"
          </p>
          <p>
            When the participants have presented, the audience will, at the show
            of hands, decide who has the best project. Come and hear about some
            exciting projects from residents and support your favorite
            candidate!

            There are great prices on the table when we invite you to Tietgen
            Festival's answer to Bingo: TRASH OR TREASURE. You just need to show
            up in the circle, get a free bingo ticket and then you have the
            chance to win prizes with a total value of 10.000 kr. But of course
            there will be some obstacles to get the great prices. If you get
            bingo, the wheel of fortune will decide if you are going away with
            trash or treasure.
