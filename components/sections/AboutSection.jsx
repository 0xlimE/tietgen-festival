    <SectionTitle>ABOUT TIETGEN FESTIVAL</SectionTitle>
    <p>
   Tietgen Festival is the annual festival at the Tietgen Residence Hall! The dorm houses 390 students
   from different educational backgrounds and nationalities. Once a year in May, all friends and
   neighbors of the dorm are invited into the circle to experience the Tietgen Spirit. The ambition
   is to create a festival where friends and neighbors can enjoy the dorm and its unique possibility for cultural mediation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The festival distinguishes itself from other festivals by being not just another party, but by
      being a festival which promotes curiosity, learning and cultural experiences alongside the
      great party! The festival is non-profit and is entirely run by volunteers from the dorm.
      All residents are invited to pitch in and help shape the festival from the festival vision.
